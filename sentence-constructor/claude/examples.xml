        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?

	- BAD: in the vocabularly table it did not show the Japanese characters, the cells are blank
	- BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabularly table
	- BAD: In the clues, we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out. 
	- BAD: The sentence structure says too much, we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location][Subject][Verb],[Object][Verb-past]?

Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a table of vocabulary to get us started:

| Japanese | Romaji  | English            |
|----------|---------|--------------------|
|          | kuma    | bear               |
|          | tobira  | door               |
|          | gomi    | garbage            |
|          | naka    | inside/out         |
|          | soto    | outside            |
|          | aru     | to exist           |
|          | okosu   | to leave something out |
|          | miru    | to see/look        |

Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Bears are at the door" and "did you leave the garbage out?".

Possible sentence structure:
Clause 1: Topic ( Bears ) + Location ( at the door ) + Existence ( are )
Clause 2: Question ( did you ) + Action ( leave ) + Object ( the garbage ) + Location ( out )

Your turn! Can you try to assemble the sentence using the vocabulary and structure above?

    - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations

    Cheatsheet:

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
