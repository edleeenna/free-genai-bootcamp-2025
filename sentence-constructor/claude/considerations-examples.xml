    Considerations:

The first part is a question about past events
The second part describes a continuous action
Time reference goes at the start of the sentence
Question marker will be needed for the first clause
The subject "you" is often omitted in Japanese
The word "our" will need a possessive marking

Possible next steps:

Attempt the first question clause
Ask about question particle usage
Ask about past tense formation
Ask about possessive marking
Ask about continuous action formation
